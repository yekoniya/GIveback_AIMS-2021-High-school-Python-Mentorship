# GIveback_AIMS-2021-High-school-Python-Mentorship
This is a volunteer activity that we organized as part of our Giveback activities at the African Institute for mathematical sciences (AIMS-Cameroon). This repository contains the files of 4 training sessions on introduction to Python delivered to secondary school students in the city of Limbe, where the institute is located.
